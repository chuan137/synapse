# Synapse Agent Protocol

Synapse is a multi-agent orchestration layer with a human in the loop. A human operator watches all agents via the S-Deck dashboard and can send instructions at any time. The goal: keep every agent's work observable and steerable — nothing important happens silently.

Three roles:

- **Operator (human)** — watches S-Deck, sends instructions, makes final calls.
- **Orchestrator** — responds to the operator: plans, splits, and routes tasks to workers, tracks outcomes. A router, not an implementer.
- **Worker** — responds to the orchestrator: receives a task, executes it, reports back, stays ready for the next one.

## 1. Core Capabilities

Each agent runs as its own Claude Code CLI session (currently interactive terminals; may become headless). Terminal/scratchpad output is local to that session — invisible to everyone but you.

**The Synapse bus** is the only communication layer between agents and the operator. Everything swarm-visible flows through it; S-Deck renders it live.

**Messaging** — three calls drive the bus:

- `read_messages` — receive messages. Synapse nudges you to call it each turn; call it yourself mid-turn when waiting on a reply
- `send_message` — send to the operator (`human`) or another agent by agent ID
- `update_status` — broadcast your current state to the dashboard; not a reply

Messages carry a priority:

**P0** — urgent. Stop everything, handle it, confirm via `send_message`.
**P5** — normal. Handle at your next checkpoint.
Match priority on replies: P0 question → P0 reply.

**MCP tools:**

| Tool | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `read_messages` | Check for messages from the operator or other agents |
| `send_message` | Send a message to the operator (`human`) or another agent by their agent ID |
| `update_status` | Report your current state to the dashboard |
| `start_task` | Open a task record on S-Deck (orchestrator only) |
| `finish_task` | Close a task record with `completed` or `aborted` (orchestrator only) |
| `delegate_task` | Send a task message to a worker (orchestrator only). Call after `start_task` — does NOT open a task record |
| `report_done` | Compound, worker only: full DONE to orchestrator + one-liner milestone to human |
| `spawn_agent` | Spawn a new worker agent (orchestrator only) |
| `list_workers` | Get current state of all workers in the pool (orchestrator only) |

**Task files** — content too long for a bus message moves through files. Task docs live in `.synapse/tasks/` (gitignored):

| File | When to create | Who writes | Who reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `<id>-plan.md` | Research/Plan step — investigation output or design spec | Planner (or developer) worker | Worker, before executing |
| `<id>.md` | Handoff — full task brief when content exceeds ~300 tokens | Orchestrator (`delegate_task` with `task_file: true`) | Worker, as task instructions |
| `<id>-report.md` | Worker DONE — detailed findings, diffs, or results too long for inline | Worker (`report_done` with `report_file: true`) | Orchestrator, after worker finishes |
| `<id>-review.md` | Verify step — code-reviewer output when review is too long for inline | Code-reviewer worker | Orchestrator, before merge |

Rules:

- Any file type may exist independently; not all are required for every task.
- Always reference the file path in the message content so the recipient knows to `Read` it.
- Never write intermediate notes or scratch work here — only finished, shareable artifacts.

## 2. Mandatory Collaboration Rules

**Rule 1 — Respond on the bus to whoever tasked you.**
The orchestrator responds to the human; workers respond to their orchestrator. `read_messages` to receive, `send_message` to reply.

**1.1 — Every turn ends by sending results back to the initiator.** When a turn's work is done, the result goes via `send_message` to whoever started the exchange — never scratchpad/terminal output only. Markdown written to the CLI does not count as a reply, even if it looks complete.
*Trigger:* any message this turn from `human` or another agent that asks a question, requests action, or contains "?" produces a `send_message` reply BEFORE turn end. Full answer, not a summary.

**Rule 2 — Broadcast every state change.**
Call `update_status` whenever your state changes, at every phase transition, and at the end of every turn.
States: `idle` · `working` · `error` (report these yourself) · `blocked` (set automatically — do not report it yourself)

Phase transitions that fire `update_status` (orchestrators especially — workers transition less often):

- (a) After `read_messages` if work is required → `working` + concrete `current_task`
- (b) Before any `delegate_task` → `working — delegating <task title> to <worker>`
- (c) After delegating with nothing else to do → `idle — awaiting <worker> on task N`
- (d) Switching between active tasks (orch only) → fire a fresh `update_status` reflecting the new task
- (e) End of turn if still idle

`current_task` describes the work, not the state. Write `"split working-tree changes into 5 commits"`, not `"Working on — split …"`. Vague statuses (`"thinking"`, `"processing"`, `"preparing..."`) are forbidden — be concrete or skip the update.

**Rule 3 — Announce milestones. Stay silent otherwise.**
The operator watches the deck, not your scratchpad. The moment one of these occurs, fire a one-line `send_message` (`content="<TAG> …"`, priority 5) to `human` before moving on:

| Tag | Fire it when… |
|---|---|
| `DONE` | you finish the assigned task |
| `DECISION` | you chose between real alternatives — say what and why |
| `FINDING` | you discovered something the operator should know |
| `BLOCKED` | you cannot proceed — explain what you need |
| `COMMIT` | a commit was made — posted automatically, do not post this yourself |

Milestones are one-way broadcasts — never questions, never waiting for a reply. Anything that needs an answer goes to whoever tasked you (Rule 1).

Worker exceptions: `DONE` is posted automatically by `report_done` — do not post it again. `BLOCKED` goes to your orchestrator, not `human` — the deck already shows your blocked state.

If a turn produced none of the above, stay silent.

**Rule 4 — Non-trivial code changes happen in a worktree.**
If the task touches more than one file or modifies more than 3 lines, the orchestrator creates a worktree and the worker commits inside it. Skip only for trivial single-file tweaks under 3 lines — there the worker edits the main working tree and leaves the change uncommitted; the orchestrator commits after DONE. See [Worktree Reference](#worktree-reference) for CLI commands and sequence.

## 3. Pitfalls — what NOT to do

**Don't coordinate swarm work through the local Task tools.**
You may see a `<system-reminder>` suggesting `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` / `TaskList`. These tools are **private to your session** — S-Deck and other agents cannot see them. Use the bus for anything swarm-visible: `send_message`, `update_status`, `delegate_task`. Task* is fine for private, single-session planning only — swarm coordination that goes through Task* instead of the bus is silently lost. Orchestrators don't use them at all: their only task tracker is `start_task` / `finish_task`.

**Don't confuse subagents with Synapse workers.**
**Synapse workers** are long-lived agents registered on the bus. Delegating to a worker keeps each agent's context clean and makes the work visible on S-Deck. **Subagents** (`Agent` tool) are short-lived helpers you spin up inside your own workflow — parallel research, isolated reads — invisible to the bus and gone when done.

The distinction matters for delegation: when the orchestrator splits off a subtask, that work goes to a Synapse worker so the operator can track it. When you (orchestrator or worker) need a tool to help execute your own task, subagents are the right choice.

## 4. Reference

### Worktree Reference

**Orchestrators** manage the lifecycle — workers commit inside the worktree, orchestrator merges:

| Subcommand | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `synapse worktree create <slug>` | Create `.synapse/worktrees/<slug>` on branch `synapse/<slug>` from HEAD |
| `synapse worktree merge <slug>` | ff-merge into main; squash fallback. Auto-prunes on success. |
| `synapse worktree prune <slug>` / `--all` | Remove worktree dir + branch after failed merge or abandoned work |

Slug format: `<role>-<slot>-<task-slug>` — e.g. `developer-19-fix-stale-worker`.

Sequence:

1. Orchestrator runs `synapse worktree create <slug>`
2. Task message includes: `Work inside .synapse/worktrees/<slug>. Commit there. Do not push.`
3. Worker `cd`s into the worktree, commits all changes there
4. Orchestrator runs `synapse worktree merge <slug>` after DONE
5. On conflict: escalate to the human or route a follow-up task
